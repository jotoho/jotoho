# About me

I'm Jonas, usually known under my username @jotoho online and currently a student of computer science at
[South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-swf.de/en/international_3/index.php)
([@fhswf](https://github.com/fhswf) here on GitHub).

Before beginning my studies in September of 2021, I attended [a vocational college in Olsberg,
Germany](https://www.berufskolleg-olsberg.de) for three years where I successfully completed my
training to become a "staatlich geprÃ¼fter informationstechnischer Assistent"
(rough translation: "state certified assistant for information technology").

I have the most experience with the C/C++ and Java programming languages but am also interested in
learning more about Kotlin and Rust. Other languages I have worked with before include Python 3 and
Lua and I have done a small amount of Android App Development in Java.

Aside from software development, I am also interested in learning more about the operational side
of computing. I'm currently operating a beginners homelab comprised of one Raspberry Pi 4 running
[about a dozen small services](https://www.jotoho.de/servers/) in docker containers for personal use.

One of those is [my currently very small static website](https://www.jotoho.de) which is
generated with some help from [the Zola static site generator](https://www.getzola.org) and hosted
[using a customized docker container](https://gitea.jotoho.de/jotoho/site-deployer)
of [the Caddy webserver](https://caddyserver.com). I hope to add some blog posts to that website in
the future, if I come up with interesting ideas.
